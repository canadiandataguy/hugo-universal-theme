  # Hello, I'm **Soni**
  
  #### Real Time Streaming Specialist | Data Architect | Data, Automation And Analytics| Tech Writer


  I am an end-to-end Full Stack Data Developer who can set up infrastructures, design the architecture, build data pipelines, and productionalize with DevOps. I have spent six years in AWS & Amazon as a Data Architect/Engineer and have a proven record of taking multi-petabyte workloads to production while ensuring minimum operational burden.  
  
  
  I also have hands-on experience in Streaming and Batch Analytics, including real-time applications. Having worked remotely for around 6+ years, Iâ€™ve learned to avoid the pitfalls of distributed team communication. 
  
  
  My goal is to democratize knowledge and help remove the barrier of the hype around Big Data. I write on topics such as real-time data streaming, data architecture, salary negotiation, financial literacy, and more.
  
  
  In my free time, I love to travel so much so that in April 2022, I finished my 12-month-long road trip across Canada. Alright, now click on a few buttons and scroll through the pages to learn more about me and how I can help you. See you on the other side!
