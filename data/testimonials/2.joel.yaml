text: "Jitesh was a pleasure to work with on our lakehouse build out project. He excelled at understanding our business logic and requirements, clarifying any ambiguities, and then translating them into code. The technical solutions he created were effective, clean, and easily maintainable. Furthermore, he was receptive to feedback and was open to making adjustments to fit his implementations into our standards and practices. Beyond just the tasks he worked directly on, Jitesh was an effective communicator -- able to proactively provide helpful advice on other items and answer questions about the many technologies he is knowledgeable on.

In conclusion, I think Jitesh reflects very well on Databricks and I was glad to have the chance to work with him and would definitely do so again in the future.
