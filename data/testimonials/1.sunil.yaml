text: "I have had the pleasure of working with Jitesh for 3+ years at Amazon. He is always curious to learn new technologies and implement them when the situation and use case apply. He is an expert at big data technologies and is always looking for ways to build simple solutions to seemingly complex problems. He has built and scaled pipelines that handle petabytes of data and his solutions have seldom resulted in operational issues post-deployment. I am hopeful we will work again!"
