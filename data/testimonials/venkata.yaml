text: "Jitesh was extremely good at targeting the DOs and DON'Ts during the interview. His familiarity and broad exposure to systems design and database design concepts reflects the way he guides others in correct decision making during the design interviews. To add to his technical expertise and being up-to-date on the systems design areas, is his profound quality of going above and beyond to help candidates aces through the interviews. He never shuns off from taking the ownership of guiding the candidates throughout the process though he gets paid just for the one hour sessions here. Being extremely approachable is another quality that I like the most in him."
