When I started learning about Spark Streaming, I could not find enough code/material which could kick-start my journey and build my confidence. I wrote this blog to fill this gap which could help beginners understand how simple streaming is and build their first application.

In this blog, I will explain most things by first principles to increase your understanding and confidence and you walk away with code for your first Streaming application.
