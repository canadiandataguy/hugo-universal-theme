[ARC has deployed the Databricks Lakehouse Platform to enable its drilling engineers to monitor operational metrics in near real-time, so that we can proactively identify any potential issues and enable agile mitigation measures](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2022/05/24/arc-uses-a-lakehouse-architecture-for-real-time-data-insights-that-optimize-drilling-performance-and-lower-carbon-emissions.html). 
  In addition to improving drilling precision, this solution has helped us in reducing drilling time for one of our fields. Time saving translates to reduction in fuel used and therefore a reduction in CO2 footprint that result from drilling operations.
