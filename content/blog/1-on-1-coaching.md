**Welcome! I am a [Super Coach](https://app.igotanoffer.com/coaching/tech/jitesh/)** . I have worked at some of the biggest tech companies, including Databricks & Amazon.  I make great efforts to use my platform to share resources and show folks the path of growth that exists without taking the management ladder track while inspiring many immigrants and people of colour to understand and realize their true market potential. To further my mission, I help folks negotiate job offers, $2+ Million negotiated so far.

## What actions can candidates take to stand out?
* Blog your learnings: They do not have to be perfect but document your understanding.
* Contribute to a open source project even in a small way; it still counts a lot.
* Create public facing material in any form.
* Create your own website and curate your material. Tip: Google Sites will let you create one for free.
* It is essential to build a public portfolio of projects relevant to your target companies (and their business domain) so that you already come across as an attractive candidate to the hiring managers and teams.
