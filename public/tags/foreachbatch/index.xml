      <description>Simplifying Real-time Data Processing with Spark Streaming’s foreachBatch with working code Comprehensive guide to implementing a fully operational Streaming Pipeline that can be tailored to your specific needs. In this working example, you will learn how to parameterize the ForEachBatch function.
Spark Streaming &amp;amp; foreachBatch Spark Streaming is a powerful tool for processing streaming data. It allows you to process data as it arrives, without having to wait for the entire dataset to be available.</description>

      <description>Merge Multiple Spark Streams Into A Delta Table with working code This blog will discuss how to read from multiple Spark Streams and merge/upsert data into a single Delta Table. We will also optimize/cluster data of the delta table.
Overall, the process works in the following manner:
Read data from a streaming source
Use this special function ***foreachBatch. ***Using this we will call any user-defined function responsible for all the processing.</description>

We will also optimize/cluster data of the delta table. In the end, we will show how to start a streaming pipeline with the previous target table as the source.
